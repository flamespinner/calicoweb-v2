        <p>Calico County RP is a growing community centered around 1889 western roleplay through our RedM server. Our main goal is to build a community focused on having quality roleplay and positive interactions and experiences for both new and veteran RPers. We want to provide a place where players are provided the tools and support to be able to tell the story you want and to have fun doing so. At the base level, we want a server that is easy for newcomers to both RP and RedM alike to be able to learn and get their toes wet, a place where all feel welcome, and a county that has unique tools that allow players to tell the story they want to.
